# SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR)

**Implementation of SETR paper: Rethinking Semantic Segmentation from a Sequence-to-Sequence Perspective with Transformers [1]**

1. Implemented the ViT Based Encoder  
2. Implemented the 3 proposed variants of the decoder:  
   - Naive Upsampling  
   - Progressive Upsampling  
   - Multi-level Feature Aggregation  
3. Trained the model on a subset of the Cityscapes dataset [2]
