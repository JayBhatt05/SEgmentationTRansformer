**Implementation of SETR paper: Rethinking Semantic Segmentation from a Sequence-to-Sequence Perspective with Transformers [1]**
<br>
<br>
1. Implemented the ViT Based Encoder<br>
2. Implemented the 3 proposed variants of the decoder, 1. Naive Upsampling, 2. Progressing Upsampling, 3. Multi-level Feature Aggregation
3. Trained the model on a subset of the Cityscapes dataset [2]
